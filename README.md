## Description

Santex Back-end Developer Hiring Test

The goal is to create a project that exposes an API built with GraphQL, with a mutation and some queries.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Node

## Installation

- Clone the code
- Change the file `.env.template` to `.env`.
  - Get a Football-data API key from [here]([https://www.football-data.org/])
  - Replace the value of `FOOTBALL_API_TOKEN` in the `.env` file
  - Set appropriate values for `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- Execute
  ```bash
  $ docker-compose build
  $ docker-compose up
  ```
- The app is up and running in port `LISTENING_PORT` (3003)
- You can use the playground on http://localhost:3003/graphql


## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ docker exec -it app sh -c "npm run test"

```

## Decision Making

### Web Framework

The decision to use [Nest]([https://www.nestjs.com]) as a web framework was because it is an open-source framework with a lot of adoption in the market, the documentation is of great quality, and it is easy to learn, especially for people who have a background in Angular. It is based on Express, a widely used framework, but also allows us to replace it with Fastify, another new framework. 
It also provides a fast and easy integration with ORMs such as TypeOrm, Prisma, Knex.js, and others. It also provides great ease to implement GraphQL through Apollo. It is a modern and versatile framework for different circumstances.
